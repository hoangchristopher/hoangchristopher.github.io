        <h1>Project 1: Images of the Russian Empire -- Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii Photo Collection</h1>
  
        <div id="reflection" class="reflection-wrapper">
          <p>
            The Prokudin-Gorskii Photo Collection is a set of digitized glass plate images that are 
            split into three different color channels: red, green, and blue. When aligning these 
            three color channels and overlaying them atop one another, you can construct a full-color image. In this project, we will be 
            exploring a few different ways of automating this process.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Part 1: Single-scale Alignment (with Euclidean Distance / L2)</h2>

        <div id="reflection" class="reflection-wrapper">
          <p>
            The raw data from the collection contains images that show the three color channels 
            stacked vertically. To separate the channels, we can represent the entire image file 
            as a matrix of float values that correspond to each pixel. From there, 
            we can use slicing techniques to split the matrix into three equal parts. However, a purely 
            proportional approach to splitting these three channels and overlaying them on top of each 
            other won't result in an appealing image. This is due to various things like the slight variance 
            in each scene's color channels that stem from the entropy involved with taking three separate 
            images, not lining up the three channels during the scanning process, etc.   
          </p>
          <p>
            So, we need to employ a technique that will help us align each color channel optimally. The 
            core of our approach with be searching over a window of possible displacements (i.e. [-15, 15] pixels in both the vertical and horizontal direction) 
             for each color channel while using a scoring metric to determine which placement is the 
            most optimal. The alignment process will have one color channel serve as the "anchor" that the 
            other two will be aligned to. The first metric we'll try is the Euclidean Distance, which is the square root of the sum of the square 
            differences between each pixel of the images. Since Euclidean Distance measures the distance between 
            each pixel value, the displacement with the lowest resulting Euclidean Distance between a color 
            channel and its anchor channel will be deemed the most optimal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, at this point, we will use single-scale alignment. The "single-scale" here refers to only involving 
            one scale of the respective image you are trying to align (we can see how this can be expanded on 
            later). 
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are the results of using Euclidean Distance with single-scale alignment to construct some 
            full-color images from the Prokudin-Gorskii Photo Collection. Note: These images were aligned with 
            the blue channel acting as the "anchor," unless stated otherwise.

      <div id="reflection" class="reflection-wrapper">
            <p>
              Here is an image titled "cathedral." When I initially implemented single-scale alignment 
              without image pre-processing (cropping), the image came out pretty well. However, 
              as I progressed through the assignment and implemented image pre-processing into the color 
              channel alignment process, this altered the results of the "cathedral" image to look like the image on the left. However, this 
              ended up being fixed by anchoring the image alignment to the green channel instead of the blue 
              channel. The cropping of edge values in the image matrix must have resulted in an unexpected 
              misrepresentation of where the "optimal" channel displacement due to different calculations.
            </p>
        </div>

        


      <h2>Part 2: Multi-scale Pyramid Alignment (with NCC)</h2>
      <div id="reflection" class="reflection-wrapper">
            <p>
              With smaller images like the ones shown above, single-scale alignment is serviceable, 
              as optimal pixel displacements aren't going to be too big. However, in the case of 
              higher resolution glass plate scans, exhaustively searching to find a relatively 
              larger pixel displacement is going to take a lot of time. To fix this, we can utilize 
              multi-scale pyramid alignment, as opposed to single-scale alignment. Multi-scale 
              pyramid alignment sees us constructing an "image pyramid," which is simply a collection 
              of copies of a respective image that are iteratively downscaled. With the lower-resolution 
              copies of the high-resolution image, we can quickly perform our alignment algorithms to 
              receive an estimate of where the optimal displacement should be for the next, higher-resolution 
              versions of the image.
            </p>
            <p>
              For implementation specifics, we can recursively scale our image by 0.5 until its color 
              channels have a height below 50 pixels. Then, we find the estimated optimal displacement 
              on the smallest version of the image, and then return the result to the next highest resolution 
              version of the image, which should be twice as big as the current level. Now at the next highest 
              resolution, we scale the estimated optimal displacement by 2 (again, because we are now working 
              with an image that is twice as big), and then run the alignment algorithm centered around this estimated 
              optimal displacement. This saves us a lot of time and computing power because we already know that 
              the optimal displacement should be in this region of the image, and we don't have to spend time 
              looking anywhere else. From there, we repeat this process until we can finally run the alignment algorithm the full-resolution 
              image. 
            </p>
            <p>
              With this section of the project, I also implemented Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC), an 
              alignment method to use instead of Euclidean Distance. NCC involves takng the dot product between 
              two normalized vectors, where the two vectors are vertical, 1-column, equivalents of the image 
              matrices belonging to the image-to-be-aligned and anchor image respectively. Here, a higher resulting 
              dot product correlates to better alignment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another thing I implemented to improve result quality was predefined border cropping. Given that 
              the majority of these images have some type of somewhat solid-colored border, leaving these borders 
              in during the alignment process would result in a fasely high correlation due to the matching borders 
              (when we would rather find high correlation toward the middle of the image). To do this, I simply 
              used slicing techniques to crop the outer 5% of each color channel after partitioning them from the 
              source image.

            Here is an image titled "emir." When implementing the project's specifications and 
            compiling the results, "emir" would always come out incorrect. 
            The "optimal" final displacement would always balloon and result in a final image 
            that looked like the left image. However, I was able to fix this by anchoring 
            the alignment process to the green channel of "emir," which resulted in the image 
            on the right. This is most likely due to the different brightness levels of each 
            color channel causing NCC metric to behave unexpectedly when anchored on certain channels 
            when compared to others.
